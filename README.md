# Voice assistant script

In todays hectic world, everyone needs a helping hand, be it messaging or searching up addresses or more advanced things. The script here is just a reference for the limitless potential that the speech recognition module provides.

The code here have these basic functions.
1) Ability to have mulitple different interactions with you
2) Play any music
3) Send messages through whatsapp
4) Search up people
5) Give the current time

## Whatsapp Function
For the whatsapp function, I have utilised the selenium module to make the whole process cleaner and much more easier to code. The whatsapp function is not exactly foolproof yet since there can be 2 people with the same name or names that are hard to be coherently detected by our speech recognition module. There are alternative solutions to this by using other modules that takes in a number and a message but this requires a complete list of contact numbers which I do not have. 

Do follow a youtube installation guide when you are installing selenium, we do not want to mess up our computers when we are coding.

## Future Ideas
The new telegram bot module(Botfather) seems quite interesting, you could potentially incorprate this code and a telegram bot into one all use assistant. With the rise of conversation ai bots, we could also utilise their module to give us an interesting and unique each time that we talk to them instead of us coding which actions determine which interaction that we get.
